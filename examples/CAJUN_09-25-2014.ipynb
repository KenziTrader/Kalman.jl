      "The Kalman filter is a way to estimate the state of a system given some knowledge of the (possibly stochastic) dynamics of that system and some noisy data collected from the system. Basically you take your state estimate, run it through the system model to advance it in time (along with the covariance matrix of your estimate), then you update your state estimate and state covariance matrix with the information gained from the data you have collected.\n",

      "Imagine we have a voltmeter taking measurements of a noisy but, on average, constant circuit. We first need a linear state-space model of this system that looks like $ x_{k+1} = Ax_k+w_k$. Because the voltage of the circuit doesn't change from time to time, we set $A=1$ and find our model $ x_{k+1} = x_k + w_k$ where $w_k$ is a vector of white Gaussian noise with variance $Q$.\n",

      "The second half of the Kalman filter model is an observation model which relates the measurements you take from the system to the system state. It takes the form $ z_{k} = Hx_k + v_k$ where $v_k$ is white Gaussian noise with variance $R$. For our example, we just take direct measurements of the voltage, so $H=1$.\n",
